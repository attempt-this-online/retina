## 0.7.1

- New general option: `\` suppresses a stage's trailing linefeed. Like `;` and `:`, it's relative position with respect to closing loops is relevant.

## 0.7.1

- Hotfix release: Mono could no longer read input from a pipe, which is fixed now.

## 0.7.0

- **Important change:** Single-file mode is now the default, so there is no more `-s` flag. Instead, the previous default behaviour can be recovered with the new `-m` flag.
- Retina now supports ISO 8859-1 encoded source files (in fact, it will assume ISO 8859-1 if the file is neither valid UTF-8 nor UTF-32).
- #11: Replace mode has been rewritten from scratch to avoid using `Regex.Replace`. This will allow many new features for the replacement syntax in the future.
- #22: Add `$n` as an escape sequence for linefeeds to replacement syntax.
- #29: Fixed a bug with the overlapping matches option `&`.
- #30: Don't block for input if invoked from the console. Input needs to be piped into the program now.
- #37: In single-file mode, pilcrows (`Â¶`) are replaced with linefeeds unless the `-P` flag is used.

## 0.6.1

- Add new stage type: Transliterate.

## 0.6.0

- Stage types can now be mixed, which (among other things) allows applying a 
  Match stage to the result of one or more Replace stages. An odd number of
  stages is now allowed and makes the last stage default to Match mode.
- #21: Improve defaults for Silent mode. One can now choose between making
  individual stages Silent (or not) or entire loops. By default only the
  last, outermost loop is not Silent, which means you always get only a
  single output regardless of whether the last stage is looped.

## 0.5.0

First numbered version. Notable changes over previous version:

- #19: Intermediate stages are silent by default.
- #15: Stages can be grouped into loops.
